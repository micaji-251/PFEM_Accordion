## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM
- JS Events


### What I learned

In the body i had to apply multiple backgrounds, an image and color.
In the css, i has to add flexbox with buttons in the extreme right i had to evaluate to use space-between or not use flexbox and use float:right.
In the Js i had to use DOM to get the elements i needed to be able to show and hide elements. Also i applied logic to be able to evaluate if it is already open hide and vice versa.

### Continued development

My objetive is to improve my css and js logic to optimize resources.

### Useful resources

- [Backgound image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) - This helped me to use multiple backgrounds.
